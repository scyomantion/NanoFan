# NanoFan

A custom fan controller for HP D2600 based on Arduino Nano

It is a header for Arduino Nano. You connect the fans with the header and the header with the old fan plugs so that the Arduino acts like a man in the middle. 

The original fans could be controlled by a pwm signal and there is a fake rpm signal sent to the original controller.
